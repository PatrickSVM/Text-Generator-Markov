    "We decided to store all the neighbours to compute the probabilities for next words in a NxN neighbour numpy matrix. But after computing it, the code to find a string still took very long (even though the values were already computed and we only had to find the probabilities in the matrix and do a random choice). But then we discovered, that the `np.random.choice()` method is far slower (~14x slower, 9.4s vs. 0.59) if choosing from a string list compared to a numeric list with indices. The following profiles show both methods for 2000 words after computing the next_matr neighbour matrix:"
